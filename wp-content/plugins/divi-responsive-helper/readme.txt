# DIVI Responsive Helper

This Plugin will auto enable the three responsive options i.e Desktop, Table and mobile while you are in DIVI visual builder.

### very easy to use!
Just install the plugin, activate it, and boom it's all done. our plugin will take care of rest of the things and you will see responsive settings options in visual builder.
There are two settings to choose from which eliminate widows in all headings and paragraph text on your website. The first dropdown is the number of words allowed on the last line of a headline, which applies for all h1-h6 headings. The second dropdown is the number of words allowed on the last line of any paragraph, whether that be in a text module, blurb module, accordion, blog post, or anywhere else on your Divi website. You simply choose a number from the dropdowns for the heading and paragraph styles to fix, and the Divi Responsive Helper handles everything else.

## Edit with Peace of Mind

No need to turn on the responsive settings each time you open a DIVI builder. our plugin will do this task for you saving you a lot time and mistakes.

## Quickly Pays For Itself

Considering all the time you will save, Divi Responsive Helper pay for itself easily on the first website (you can use it on as many sites and you want). Spend less time opening and closing responsiv settings, getting confused, making mistakes and spend more time being creative!
